Thank you for giving me a peer review :)


I looked at your code and everything works well. I noticed that you used while loops so that the program can run as much as the user wants it. Data validation is there, and it's a lot different method from the last time he did this project. Overall good proj, This is peer reviewed by : John Magpantay
